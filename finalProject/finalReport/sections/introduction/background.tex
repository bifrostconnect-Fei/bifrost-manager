% This project is the final project of the EASV computer science program. 
% The purpose of the final project is to demonstrate the knowledge 
% and skills by the student during the two and a half years of study,
% and be able to fully demonstrate them in a project.

% In this project, the student will work with a company 
% to solve a problem of the company.
% The student will use the knowledge and skills learned from the education
% to solve the problem.

% Which means this project will be relevant to the company's business domain,
% and will utilize software engineering methods and software development methods
% to recognize, analyze, and solve the problem.

% An introduction to the project type and background
% This project serves as the capstone for the EASV Computer Science program, 
% designed to encapsulate the knowledge and skills students have acquired over two and a half years of study. 
% The project, a software development endeavor, is rooted in real-world application, 
% aiming to address a specific issue faced by a partnering company.

This project marks the culmination of the EASV Computer Science program. 
Its primary objective is to showcase the breadth and depth of knowledge 
and skills that the student has amassed over two and a half years of rigorous study,
and to apply these competencies in a practical setting.

In the scope of this project, the student will collaborate with a company 
to tackle a specific problem they are encountering.
The student will leverage the knowledge and skills gleaned from their education
to devise a solution.

This implies that the project will be directly relevant to the company's business domain,
and will employ both software engineering and software development methodologies
to identify, analyze, and ultimately resolve the problem.
