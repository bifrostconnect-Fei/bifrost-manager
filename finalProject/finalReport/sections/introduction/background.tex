This project marks the culmination of the EASV Computer Science program. 
Its primary objective is to showcase the breadth and depth of knowledge 
and skills that the student has amassed over two and a half years of study,
and to apply these competencies in a practical setting.

In the scope of this project, the student will collaborate with a company 
to tackle a specific problem they are encountering.
The student will leverage the knowledge and skills gleaned from their education
to devise a solution.

This implies that the project will be directly relevant to the company's business domain,
and will employ both software engineering and software development methodologies
to identify, analyze, and ultimately resolve the problem.
