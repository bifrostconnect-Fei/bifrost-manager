BifrostConnect, a startup founded in 2018, 
is a dedicated team of 10 to 12 professionals based in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Over the past five years, the company has developed a unique solution for remote access system. 

This solution is specifically designed for systems that operate 
under strict security conditions and are not permitted to have internet connectivity.
Instead of relying on third-party services, BifrostConnect uses a relay device to facilitate remote access.

BifrostConnect's main offering is a hardware device coupled with a network application. 
This combination enables secure, remote access to client systems. 

In addition to this, the company provides related services 
and comprehensive solutions to cater to a wide range of client needs.
