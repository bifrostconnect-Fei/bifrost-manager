"Feature Driven Development (FDD) is an iterative and incremental software development process." \cite{fdd}

    The FDD is a model-driven short-iteration process that consists of five basic activities:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Develop an overall model
        \item Build a feature list
        \item Plan by feature
        \item Design by feature
        \item Build by feature
    \end{enumerate}
