The first step of the FDD is to develop an overall model. The overall model is a domain model that preposed to let the application
can have a basic structure and can be run for no feature.
After the overall model is developed, the feature list can be created for adding the features to the application.

In this project, the overall model is more like a pototype or demo of the application.

\paragraph{Front-end overall model}
At the front-end side, the overall model is a simple web page that can be used to show the basic structure of the application.
Following the core concept of the React, the front end overall model will be only repersents the view of the application.

\paragraph{Back-end overall model}
At the back-end side, the overall model is data server which have the basic structure and a simple data model.
The prepose of the backend overall model is not to provide any of the service or interface to eather the front-end or the database.
It only use for the architecrure design to make sure the server side scalable and modular.

\paragraph{Database overall model}
The database overall model will indentify the bussiness domain of the application 
which is relavent to the device, user, and the data of the application.
