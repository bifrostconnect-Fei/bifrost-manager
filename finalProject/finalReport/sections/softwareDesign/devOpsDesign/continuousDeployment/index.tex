The continuing Deployment is the next step of the continuous delivery.
It is the practice of automatically deploying the software from test environment
to the production environment.

\paragraph{Production Environment}
The production environment is a server that is used to run the software. 
Basically, the production environment is the same as the test environment,
but without the test tools in the production environment.

\paragraph{Continuing Operation}
The production environment is the relay server to face to the real user.
Therefore, the production environment also includes the performance monitoring tools
to monitor the performance of the software. Response the performance issue and bugs
as soon as possible.
