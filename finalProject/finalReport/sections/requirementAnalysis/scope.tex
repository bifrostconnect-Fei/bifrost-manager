The scope of this project is to develop a web application 
that manages devices and users, and creates the RAI and Tunnel.

But since the device manager already exists, 
the main focus of this project will be on implementing the RAI and Tunnel 
into the device manager.

Therefore, there is no need to develop the device manager 
or add new features to the RAI and Tunnel interface at the beginning of the project.

As the Device Manager is built using the React framework, 
we also use the same framework to develop the RAI and Tunnel interface.

Therefore, to develop an adequate architecture for the entire system also 
be a big task for this project. 

Furthermore, due to the redundant and coupled nature of the entire system, 
we can consider redesign the system components and establish their relationships.
