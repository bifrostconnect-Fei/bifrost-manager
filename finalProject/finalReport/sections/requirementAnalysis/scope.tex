% The scope of this project is to develop a web application 
% which can be used to manage the device and users, 
% and create the RAI and Tunnel.

% Because the device manager already exist, 
% the mean focus will be on the implementation of the RAI and Tunnel into the device manager.
% Which means we don't need to develop the device manager, 
% also there are no necceary to develop the new features for the RAI and Tunnel interface.

% Because the situation of the entire system was redudent and coupling, 
% we have to re-design the system components and identify the relationship between them.
% The re-design of the system will be the main focus of this project.

% Since the Device Manager is written in React framework, 
% we have to use the same framework to develop the RAI and Tunnel interface.

The scope of this project is to develop a web application 
that manages devices and users, and creates the RAI and Tunnel.

Since the device manager already exists, 
the main focus will be on implementing the RAI and Tunnel 
into the device manager.

Therefore, there is no need to develop the device manager 
or add new features to the RAI and Tunnel interface.

Due to the redundant and coupled nature of the entire system, 
we need to redesign the system components 
and establish their relationships.

As the Device Manager is built using the React framework, 
we will also use the same framework to develop the RAI and Tunnel interface.

The main focus of this project is to migramt the RAI and Tunnel interface, 
and re-design the UI, components, and the relavent methodologies.
