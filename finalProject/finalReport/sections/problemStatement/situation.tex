The current BifrostConnect front-end application consist of the Device Manager (DM) 
and Remote Access Interface (RAI) two different user interface.
Which means the user need to manage their devices and users in the one application, 
and oprate their devices to use the bifrost product in other web application as well. 
However, the RAI consists of two different user interfaces referred to as the Classic RAI and Tunnel RAI. 
Those two user interfaces will leading the user to different web application 
when user wish to create a different type of access solution.

The reason for this situation occurred is because the bifrost product is developed focus on the device 
and the application part was not considered as important as the device part. 
Therefore, the application part was developed by different developers with different design logic.
And the application functionality was not been properly through out the development process. 
Which cause the design logic of this product is not scalable, leading to decreasing user experience, 
and exponential growth of code complexity which makes it increasingly challenging to maintain and improve. 
Also the product design style lacks scalability due to lack of modularity and code consistency, 
and the operation logic is not clear.
