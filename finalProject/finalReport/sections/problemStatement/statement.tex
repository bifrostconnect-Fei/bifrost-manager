In the scope of this project, 
the integration of the Remote Access Interface and Tunnel Interface 
into the Device Manager Application is a primary objective. 
The goal is to create a single-page application 
that fully encapsulates the functionality of both 
the Remote Access and Tunnel Connection capabilities.
