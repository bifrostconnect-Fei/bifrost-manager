To address those issue, there is a need to redesign and remake the front-end with
a focus on implementing a modular unified front-end management system that
encompasses all the necessary functionality. 

The goal is to provide users with seamless control, monitoring, and access to their devices from anywhere, 
enhancing their overall user experience and productivity while keeping code complexity as low as possible.

For the implementation to be successful, we also need to dedicate a back-end
service, including an API and Database. The back-end server will contain the
necessary service for the front-end to reach the purpose. Such as the RESTful
API service, authentication service, MQTT service, Data  Channel service and Database.
