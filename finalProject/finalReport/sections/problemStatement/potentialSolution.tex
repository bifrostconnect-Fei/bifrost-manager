To address those issue, there is a need to redesign and remake the front-end with
a focus on implementing a modular unified front-end management system that
encompasses all the necessary functionality. 

The goal is to provide users with seamless control, monitoring, and access to their devices from anywhere, 
enhancing their overall user experience and productivity while keeping code complexity as low as possible.

For the implementation to be successful, we also need to have a back-end
service, including an API and Database. The back-end server will contain the
necessary service for the front-end to reach the purpose. Such as the RESTful
API service, authentication service, MQTT service, Tunnel service and Database.

This project will follow the software design process. Therefore, it will also include
the Software Development method and DevOps on all process as well. 

This project is covered by NDA due to security and confidentiality reasons. Thus, the
project will initially not be publicly deployed, however, I will described the
deployment in my report as well.

In order to address the issues identified, 
a comprehensive overhaul of the front-end is necessary. 
This involves a complete redesign and redevelopment of the existing system, 
with a particular emphasis on creating a modular, 
unified front-end management system. 
This new system will incorporate all the necessary functionalities, 
thereby eliminating the need for multiple interfaces and improving the overall user experience.

The primary goal of this redesign is to provide users with seamless control, 
monitoring, and access to their devices, 
regardless of their location. 
By streamlining the user interface and integrating all necessary functionalities into a single, 
unified system, we aim to enhance the overall user experience and increase productivity. 
Furthermore, by focusing on modularity in the design, 
we aim to keep code complexity as low as possible, 
thereby improving maintainability and scalability of the system.

Successful implementation of this redesign requires a robust back-end service, which includes an API and a Database. The back-end server will house the necessary services for the front-end to fulfill its purpose. These services include the RESTful API service, which will handle requests and responses between the front-end and the server; an authentication service, which will ensure secure access to the system; an MQTT service, which will handle messaging between devices; a Tunnel service, which will manage the creation and maintenance of secure tunnels for remote access; and a Database, which will store and manage all necessary data.

This project will adhere to the software design process, incorporating best practices from Software Development methodologies and DevOps principles throughout all stages. This includes requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. By following this process, we aim to ensure the delivery of a high-quality, reliable, and scalable system.

Due to security and confidentiality reasons, this project is covered by a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). As such, the project will not initially be publicly deployed. However, the deployment process, including the strategies used for continuous integration and continuous deployment, as well as the measures taken to ensure security and reliability, will be described in detail in the final report.
