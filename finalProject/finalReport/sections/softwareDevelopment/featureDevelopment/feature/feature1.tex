\paragraph{Front-end}
To be able to display the data from the back-end, we need to make a request to
the back-end. The request is made by using the \texttt{fetch} API. 

In the \texttt{deviceComponet} we need use the customer hook \texttt{useGetAllDevices}
to get the device list from the back-end. 

After the request is made, we need to handle the response from the back-end.
The response is a JSON object, we need to parse the JSON object to the DOM object.

And then, we need to display the device list on the device page.

\paragraph{Back-end}

To be able to response the request from the front-end, we need to implement the webAPI controller
to handle the request.

And then, the webAPI controller will call the service to get the device list from the domain service.

The domain service will invoke the repository to get the device list from the database.

After the device list is got from the database, the domain service will return the device list to the webAPI controller.

The webAPI controller will return the device list to the front-end.
