The overall development require the minimum of the project can be operating 
without any feature as well.

Therefore, it is only necessary to develop the basic three part of the entire system.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Front-end
    \item Back-end
    \item Database
\end{itemize}

But based on the three part, the project also need the CI/CD pipeline setup,
and the unit test for the basic operation.
