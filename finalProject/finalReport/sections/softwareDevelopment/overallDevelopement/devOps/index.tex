The core of devOps process alway is the CI/CD process, this process will contral
and manage the whole software development process.

In this project, we use the GitHub Actions as the CI/CD process.
Therefore we can easily config the main.yml file inside of the .github/workflow folder.

\begin{lstlisting}
    name: CI/CD
    on: 
        push:
            branches: [ feature ]
        pull_request:
            branches: [ feature ]
    jobs:
        build:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
                - uses: actions/checkout@v2
                - name: front-end build
                    run: |
                        cd frontEnd
                        npm install
                        npm run build
                - name: back-end build
                    run: |
                        cd backEnd
                        dotnet restore
                        dotnet build
