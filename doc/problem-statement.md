# Problem statement

The current Bifrostconnect front-end tools consist of the Device Manager (DM) and Remote Access Interface (RAI). The RAI also includes user interface and tunnel connection functions. The design logic of this product can be confusing, leading to a decrease in user experience, system redundancy, and unclear functionality. The product design style lacks consistency, and the operation logic is not clear. Additionally, it is difficult to develop and maintain.

To address this issue, there is a need to redesign and remake the frontend with a focus on implementing a unified front-end management system that encompasses all the necessary functionality. The goal is to provide users with seamless control, monitoring, and access to their devices from anywhere, enhancing their overall user experience and productivity.
